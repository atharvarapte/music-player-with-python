# music-player-GUI-with-python
creating a simple music player using pygame and tkinter libraries.
Pygame is a Python library used to create video games. To create a music player with Python, we will be using the Pygame sound component.
Tkinter is a library for creating GUI applications to use the askdirectory() method of Tkinter and other methods.
Then we will create functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player. To create these commands, we’ll build some functions and we’ll use Tkinter to create the button in the interface.
